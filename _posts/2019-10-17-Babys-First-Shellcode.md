## Win32 Shellcode
Earnestly starting my Windows exploitation journey and figured a good way to get familiar with some aspects of WinAPIs would be to create some pretty basic shellcode. MSDN does a pretty nice job of documenting the APIs and their constinuent parts. 

## Recommended Reading
These blogposts are awesome and both are part of a series. Both of them really spell out every single aspect of creating dynamic shellcode that doesn't rely on hardcoded addresses. I won't spend much time in this blog post rehashing all of their wisdom, so I beg you to read them, understand them, and go through them step by step in a debugger until you understand if you're at all interested in shellcode. 

+ [Introduction to Windows Shellcode Development -- Part 3](https://securitycafe.ro/2016/02/15/introduction-to-windows-shellcode-development-part-3/) by [@NytroRST](https://twitter.com/NytroRST)

We lean more on the former blog post, but in a subsequent blogpost we will be implementing the techiques discussed more in the latter. The techniques discussed in both blog posts are pretty similar with regards to finding the base address in memory of `kernel32.dll`.

Huge thanks to @NytroRST and @NinjaParanoid for producing such high-quality content for free. It means a lot to us just starting out. 

## Working PoC
Following along with the aforementioned blogposts and trying to cobble together my own shellcode that would:
+ Find the base address in memory of `kernel32.dll`
+ Find the address API function `CreateProcessA` within `kernel32.dll`
+ Use `CreateProcessA` to spawn a calculator. 

Seems simple enough? It was actually pretty hard for me to follow along! 

### C++ Prototype 
Before we get started writing Assembly, I wanted to create a `C++` version of the `CreateProcessA` API call spawning calc so that I had a rough idea of what was required in Assembly. Consulting the [MSDN documenation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-processes), I came up with a bare-bones implementation of: 
```c++
#include <windows.h>

int main (void) 
{
    STARTUPINFO si = { sizeof(STARTUPINFO) };
    PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
    CreateProcessA(NULL, "calc", NULL, NULL, FALSE, NULL, NULL, NULL, &si, &pi);
}
```

`STARTUPINFO` is a struct with a bunch of members; however, I only really needed to initialize the first member `cb` which is an unsigned int for the size of the structure. The `PROCESS_INFORMATION` structure really didn't even need any members initialized. Most of the parameters in the `CreateProcessA` API ended up being `NULL` except for the `lpCommandLine` parameter which is of the `LPSTR` data type and is `"calc"` in this case.

### CreateProcessA Calc Shellcode v1.0
Concerned only with making shellcode that would spawn a calculator, leaving the stress of creating Null-free/optimized code aside for the time being, I came up with the following after heavily borrowing concepts from both aforementioned blog posts. Again, I beg you to go read the blog posts I mentioned earlier which explain every single step in critical detail. I copied a lot of code from both blogs, and for the final `CreateProcessA` call, I copied a lot of code from [here](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/102847/All-Windows-Null-Free-CreateProcessA-Calc-Shellcode.html).

    xor ecx, ecx                ; zero out ECX so we can use it as a counter

    ; start our loop to find a string match with our desired function, which is 'CreateProcessA'. we will end up with the ordinal of the function
    Get_Function:

    inc ecx                             ; increase ECX to keep track of our iterations
    mov ebx, [esi]                      
    add esi, 0x4                        ; get name offset
    add ebx, eax                        ; get function name 
    cmp dword [ebx], 0x61657243         ; Crea
    jnz Get_Function
    cmp dword [ebx + 0x4], 0x72506574   ; tePr

    jnz Get_Function                    ; if we get past here, we know our program has found 'CreateProcessA'

    ; now that we have the ordinal, we need to find the real address of the CreateProcessA function
    mov esi, [edx + 0x24]               ; get the offset to the "AddressOfNameOrdinals" offset from IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY
    add esi, eax                        ; offset + base address
    mov cx, [esi + ecx * 2]             ; We want index number of an array essentially. Array is full of two-byte numbers. (ecx *2)
    dec ecx                             ; accounting for index [0] of the array
    mov esi, [edx + 0x1c]               ; "AddressOfFunctions" offset
    add esi, eax                        ; offset + base address
    mov edx, [esi + ecx * 4]            ; 4 byte indexes in this new array (ecx * 4)
    add edx, eax                        ; offset + base address. EDX now holds memory addr of CreateProcessA

    ; we now have the address of CreateProcessA inside of EDX. we can call calc.exe by just placing 'calc' on the stack, and setting a pointer to it to satisfy the struct arguments 
    ; for 'lpProcessInformation' and 'lpStartupInfo'

    mov cl, 0xff                ; we'll loop 255 times (0xff)
    xor edi, edi                ; edi now 0x00000000

    zero_loop:
    push edi                    ; place 0x00000000 on stack 255 times as a way to 'zero memory' 
    loop zero_loop

    
    push 0x636c6163             ; 'calc'
    mov ecx, esp                ; stack pointer to 'calc'

    push ecx                    ; processinfo pointing to 'calc' as a struct argument
    push ecx                    ; startupinfo pointing to 'calc' as a struct argument
    xor eax, eax                ; zero out
    push eax                    ; NULLS
    push eax
    push eax
    push eax
    push eax
    push eax
    push ecx                    ; 'calc'
    push eax
    call edx                    ; call CreateProcessA and spawn calc
```

Final length: 126 bytes

Null-Free: False

## Optimizing a Bit
Our shellcode has some pretty hellacious problems, but it works! It doesn't clean up after itself, doesn't exit gracefully, contains nulls, and doesn't use any tricks to shave off bytes. We will get into calling multiple APIs and exiting in the next blog post, for now, let's just address the length and the NULL bytes. 

### Shaving Off Bytes
We use the `lodsd` instruction in this code just like @NytroRST does which saves us many bytes. It effectively does
```nasm
mov eax, DWORD PTR DS:[esi]
add esi, 0x4
```
All in just one opcode `\xAD`. So every time we use `lodsd` we end up saving 4 bytes. 

We also strategically clear registers an the beginning of our shellcode and use them to our advantage by first `xor ecx, ecx` which clears the ECX register, and then following that up with a `mul ecx` instruction which uses two opcodes (`\xF7\xE1`) to also clear EAX and EDX. This saves us 2 bytes over all. 

Lastly, instead of checking the string of the function four times which we did previously with this block of code:
```nasm 
cmp dword [ebx], 0x61657243         ; Crea
jnz Get_Function
cmp dword [ebx + 0x4], 0x72506574   ; tePr  
jnz Get_Function
cmp dword [ebx + 0x8], 0x7365636f   ; oces
jnz Get_Function
cmp word [ebx + 0xa], 0x41737365    ; essA
jnz Get_Function                    ; if we get past here, we know our program has found 'CreateProcessA'
```

We only check the beginning and the end of the string. Since we know the length of the function name we want, `CreateProcessA`, we can simply just check the beginning 4 bytes and the last 4 bytes of the name with this block of code:
```nasm
cmp dword [eax], 0x61657243          ; Crea
jnz Get_Function
cmp word [eax + 0xa], 0x41737365     ; essA
jnz Get_Function
```

We save two whole `cmp` operations here which substantially shortens our shellcode. 

### Getting Rid of Nulls
We induced null bytes at the beginning of our shellcode with this code here:
```nasm
mov eax, [eax + 0x14]
mov eax, [eax]
mov eax, [eax]
```
The last two `mov` operations end up being the opcodes `\x8B\x00`. We get rid of those by again using the `lodsd` operation followed by an `xchg` just like @NytroRST does in his post. 

### CreateProcessA Calc Shellcode v2.0
```nasm
global_start


section .text
_start: 

xor ecx, ecx
mul ecx
mov eax, [fs:ecx + 0x30] ; PEB offset
mov eax, [eax + 0xc]     ; LDR offset
mov esi, [eax + 0x14]    ; InMemOrderModList
lodsd                    ; 2nd module
xchg eax, esi            ; 
lodsd                    ; 3rd module
mov ebx, [eax + 0x10]    ; kernel32 base address
mov edi, [ebx + 0x3c]    ; e_lfanew offset
add edi, ebx             ; offset + base
mov edi, [edi + 0x78]    ; export table offset
add edi, ebx             ; offset + base
mov esi, [edi + 0x20]    ; namestable offset
add esi, ebx             ; offset + base
xor ecx, ecx             ; 

; this code works the same as previously, we're just using some new operators we already mentioned and utilizing new registers to avoid xoring out registers too often
Get_Function:
 
inc ecx                             
lodsd                                
add eax, ebx                        
cmp dword [eax], 0x61657243          
jnz Get_Function
cmp word [eax + 0xa], 0x41737365	   
jnz Get_Function
mov esi, [edi + 0x24]                
add esi, ebx                         
mov cx, [esi + ecx * 2]             
dec ecx
mov esi, [edi + 0x1c]                
add esi, ebx                         
mov edi, [esi + ecx * 4]             
add edi, ebx                         

mov cl, 0xff

zero_loop:
push edx
loop zero_loop

push 0x636c6163                      ; "calc"
mov ecx, esp

push ecx
push ecx
push edx
push edx
push edx
push edx
push edx
push edx
push ecx
push edx
call edi
```

Final length: 100 bytes

Null-Free: True

## Conclusion
This was a ton of fun, I think a good excercise for the reader would be using `CreateProcessA` to spawn a message box with custom text. In the next post, we'll make our code more robust by adding an exit function which will require finding new ways to dynamically find functions. Until next time.
