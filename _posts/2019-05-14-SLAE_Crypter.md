## Introduction

The 7th and final assignment for SLAE was create a custom encryption/decryption scheme for our shellcode. For the purposes of this excercise I chose to work with python. This assignment was a blast. Since its the last assignment, I decided to have some fun with it and went for novelty over strong encryption. I wanted a decryption scheme that only required shellcode input, so I designed the decryption function to brute force its own key!

For this excercise we'll be using a 25 byte long `execve` shellcode in the following format:
```terminal_session
\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x89\\xe2\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80
```

For an encryption scheme I used AES with imports from the `Crypto.Cipher`package. 

***Note: we are NOT using Python3***

## Encryption Process

My encryption scheme uses some fictional hacker lore as seed terms to generate a keyspace that ends up being a little over 1.4 million keys. I was shocked by how fast a computer running a poorly written python script can iterate through that many keys! At a high-level, the encryption function does the following:
+ takes shellcode input in the format of `\\xaa\\xbb\\xcc...`,
+ pads the shellcode with `\\xff` bytes to get it to a multiple of `16` (AES requires key sizes of n\*16),
+ creates an `iv` (initilialization vector of `1337133713371337`),
+ generates a keyspace with seed character names from hacker movies,
+ encrypts `input + padding` with randomly chosen `key` and `iv`, and
+ prints shellcode in format thats compatible with the decryption process.

## Decryption Process

The decryption scheme is straightforward. The script iterates through the entire keyspace decrypting the input shellcode with each key until it spots our `\\xff` padding and then it knows it has found the right key and prints the output. I picked this concept up from the SLAE coursework itself, and it was awesome to apply it to this python script.

## Execution Process

For execution, the script just appends a `shellcode.c` writing process onto the decryption function and then compiles and runs that file. 

## Usage

### Encryption

`python crypter.py --encrypt (-e) <shellcode>`:
```terminal_session
root@kali:~/petprojects/SLAE# python crypter.py -e \\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x89\\xe2\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80

[+] Encrypted Shellcode: \\x2f\\x84\\x39\\x62\\x4b\\x98\\x06\\x9b\\x8f\\xb4\\x3d\\xdc\\x5e\\x65\\x60\\xbf\\x7b\\x96\\xc6\\x52\\x9a\\x4b\\x2c\\xf8\\x5d\\x55\\x12\\x7b\\x37\\x8e\\x56\\x69
```

### Decryption

`python crypter.py --decrypt (-d) <shellcode>`:
```terminal_session
root@kali:~/petprojects/SLAE# python crypter.py -d \\x2f\\x84\\x39\\x62\\x4b\\x98\\x06\\x9b\\x8f\\xb4\\x3d\\xdc\\x5e\\x65\\x60\\xbf\\x7b\\x96\\xc6\\x52\\x9a\\x4b\\x2c\\xf8\\x5d\\x55\\x12\\x7b\\x37\\x8e\\x56\\x69

[+] Bruteforcing key for decryption...
[+] Decrypted Shellcode: \\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x89\\xe2\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80
```

### Execution

`python crypter.py --execute (-x) <shellcode>`:
```terminal_session
root@kali:~# python crypter.py -x \\x2f\\x84\\x39\\x62\\x4b\\x98\\x06\\x9b\\x8f\\xb4\\x3d\\xdc\\x5e\\x65\\x60\\xbf\\x7b\\x96\\xc6\\x52\\x9a\\x4b\\x2c\\xf8\\x5d\\x55\\x12\\x7b\\x37\\x8e\\x56\\x69
Shellcode Length:  25

# uname -a

```

The script successfully encrypts, decrypts, and executes shellcode. Success!

You can find the code below, it is pretty heavily commented to help those who are not used to reading ugly python.
