Software developer and vulnerability researcher with a current focus on fuzzing
and vulnerability research, specifically the Linux Kernel. This is where I write
blogposts about fuzzing, binary exploitation, and misc. security topics to serve
as a kind of public record of my educational journey as a new person to the
field.
